# Universal-Document-Notetaking-Software
Creating a PDF-viewer-agnostic system that allows for simple notetaking solutions.

There are many different PDF and document viewing software systems that are available. Most of them are great, especially in that limited scope. Beyond this, some companies/products will offer good markup/notetaking capabilities, but at a cost. I simply wanted the flexibility and capability to take effective notes on my documents freely. I do not want to subscribe to a product family (riddled with ecosystem attractors) just for this simple set of features. Plus, I envision an ecosystem-agnostic toolset, not unlike a broader version of the snipping tool for Windows, to make this exceptionally adaptable to new applications.
